# beamWrapper

This system is designed to provide a simple link between 
[dreamBeam](https://github.com/2baOrNot2ba/dreamBeam) and 
[iLiSA](https://github.com/2baOrNot2ba/iLiSA) by 
[Tobia Carozzi](https://github.com/2baOrNot2ba) to provide input for 
[beamModelTester](https://github.com/creaneroDIAS/beamModelTester) by
[Oisin Creaner](https://github.com/creaneroDIAS).

***Requirements***

dreamBeam and iLiSA must be installed

if dreamBeam and iLiSA source code is not installed in ${HOME}/dreamBeam and ${HOME}/iLiSA respectively, the environment variables ILISA_DIR and DB_DIR should be set to the appropriate paths

***How to use***

Run **./wrapper.sh** with a directory containing ACC files as an argument.  Optionally include a frequency to create a single-frequency output file from dreamBeam

The final ACC subdirectory name MUST be of the format  STNID_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_RCU_DURATION_SOURCE_acc 

e.g. **IE613_20180406_090450_rcu3_dur2069_CasA_acc**

***Outputs***

This system creates a HDF5 file containing the observed data from the ACC files as generated by iLiSA and a model of that same data stored in a CSV file created by dreamBeam
